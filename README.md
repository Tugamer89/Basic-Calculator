# Basic Calculator
That's a very basic calculator made by me in C++

I wanted to code a basic calculator in which to insert a string and it returns a float


## **Features:** 
  - Additions
  - Subtractions
  - Multiplications
  - Divisions
  - Exponentations
  - Square roots
  - Cubic roots
  - Cosines
  - Sines
  - Tangents
  - Arccosines
  - Arcsines
  - Arctangents
  - Logarithms in bases e, 2 and 10
  - PI

## **Known bugs:**
 - Negatives numbers at the beginning not working
 - Cubic root not working 

## **Future implementations:**
  - Code cleanup
  - Splitting the code in more files
  - The ability to use parentheses like a scientific calculator
